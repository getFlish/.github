## Hi there 👋

Flish is an application aimed at enhancing productivity. We ♥ open source. Most of our repositories are MIT licensed. Anyone can contribute to Flish.

Without open source, Flish wouldn’t exist. This is our way to give back to the community (some communist material there 😅)

## Contribute 🌈

If you want to contribute, first let us say you are awesome. Open a pull request and we will check it asap.

## Ressources 🦄

If you have any questions, we recommend joining the [Discord](https://flish.dev/discord)

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
